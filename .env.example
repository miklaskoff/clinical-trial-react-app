# OpenAI API Configuration (Optional)
# Only needed if you want to use AI-powered semantic matching
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

# REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here

# Note: For security reasons, you can enter the API key directly in the UI
# instead of storing it in this file. The key is only used client-side
# and is never sent to any server except OpenAI's API.
